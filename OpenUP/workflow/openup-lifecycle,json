  "description": "OpenUP is an iterative process with iterations distributed throughout four phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition.\n\nEach phase may have as many iterations as needed (depending on the degree of novelty of the business domain, the technology being used, architectural complexity, and project size, to name a few factors).\n\nTo offer a quick start for teams to plan their iterations, OpenUP provides work breakdown structure (WBS) templates for each iteration, and a WBS template for an end-to-end process.\n\nIterations may have variable lengths, depending on project characteristics. One-month iterations are typically recommended, because this timeframe provides:\n\nA reasonable amount of time for projects to deliver meaningful increments in functionality.\nEarly and frequent customer feedback.\nTimely management of risks and issues during the course of the project.\nOpenUP is intended to offer process guidance to small, co-located teams.",
