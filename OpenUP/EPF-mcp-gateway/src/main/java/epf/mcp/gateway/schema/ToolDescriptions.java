	String LIST_FILES_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
Lists all files in a directory.

This is useful for exploring the filesystem and finding the right file to read or edit.
You should almost ALWAYS use this tool before using the read_file or edit_file tools.
""";
	
	String READ_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
Reads a file from the filesystem.

Assume this tool is able to read all files. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- By default, it reads up to 100 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- **IMPORTANT for large files and codebase exploration**: Use pagination with offset and limit parameters to avoid context overflow
    - First scan: read_file(file_path="...", limit=100) to see file structure
    - Read more sections: read_file(file_path="...", offset=100, limit=200) for next 200 lines
    - Only omit limit (read full file) when necessary for editing
- Specify offset and limit: read_file(file_path="...", offset=0, limit=100) reads first 100 lines
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- Lines longer than 5,000 characters will be split into multiple lines with continuation markers (e.g., 5.1, 5.2, etc.). `limit` applies to source lines, so continuation rows do not consume the budget.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
- Image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, etc.), audio and video files, and PDFs are returned as multimodal content blocks (see https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/messages#multimodal).

For multimodal reads (image, audio, video, PDF, etc.):
- Use `read_file(file_path=...)`
- Do NOT use `offset`/`limit` for images (pagination is text-only)
- If file details were compacted from history, call `read_file` again on the same path

- You should ALWAYS make sure a file has been read before editing it.
""";
	
	String WRITE_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
Writes to a new file in the filesystem.

Usage:
- The write_file tool will create the a new file.
- Prefer to edit existing files (with the edit_file tool) over creating new ones when possible.
""";
	
	String EDIT_FILE_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must read the file before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file first.
- When editing, preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) from the read output. Never include line number prefixes in old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it.
""";
	
	String FIND_FILES_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
Find files matching a glob pattern.

Supports standard glob patterns: `*` (any characters), `**` (any directories), `?` (single character).
Returns a list of absolute file paths that match the pattern.

Examples:
- `**/*.py` - Find all Python files
- `*.txt` - Find all text files in the backend's default root
- `/subdir/**/*.md` - Find all markdown files under /subdir
""";
	
	String SEARCH_FILES_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """
Search for a text pattern across files.

Searches for literal text (not regex) and returns matching files or content based on output_mode.
Special characters like parentheses, brackets, pipes, etc. are treated as literal characters, not regex operators.

Examples:
- Search all files: `grep(pattern="TODO")`
- Search Python files only: `grep(pattern="import", glob="*.py")`
- Show matching lines: `grep(pattern="error", output_mode="content")`
- Search for code with special chars: `grep(pattern="def __init__(self):")`
