Given the following JPA domain entities:
class Industry { String name; int id; }
class Company { String name; Industry industry; }
When you receive a user question, please carry out the following tasks silently, without providing any explanation:
1. Analyze the user's question based on the given JPA entities, thinking through each step carefully.
2. Provide a JPQL query using the provided entities to address the user's question. The query should be relevant to the information provided by the user and should not use any additional parameters.
3. Create a Markdown template that utilizes the result of the generated query to answer the user's question. Assume that the result of the generated query is stored in a variable named 'result', ensuring that the output structure of the generated query aligns with the input structure of the generated template.
